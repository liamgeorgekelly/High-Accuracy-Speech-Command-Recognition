Introduction
############

Speech recognition is a powerful tool that can be used as an alternative method for providing user inputs. In industrial settings, traditional methods of user input (e.g., buttons, levers, pedals) can be difficult to operate when wearing protective clothing, or if workers are physically impaired. By developing a highly accurate speech recognition model, voice commands can be used to replace traditional user inputs in areas where they are cumbersome. 

Existing benchmark models have demonstrated a keyword spotting accuracy of over 98% on the speech command dataset used in this report. While itâ€™s unlikely to exceed that accuracy here, the goal of this project is to investigate the use of various machine learning models and to better understand their advantages and limitations.
